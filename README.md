# Negotiations MVC: A Study Case on MVC and Design Patterns 
The "Negotiations MVC" project is a comprehensive study case exploring the application of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and design patterns such as Proxy and Factory. The project's goal is to build a stock exchange negotiation registry, integrating functional and object-oriented programming paradigms to harness the best of both worlds.

## Overview
This study case delves into the intricacies of JavaScript's ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) features within the scope of a seemingly simple application. However, the project's modest beginnings pave the way for the application of advanced language features, code organization following the MVC model, design patterns implementation, asynchronous programming with promises, template rendering, and the use of proxies, among others.

## Features
- **Negotiation Registration**: Users can register new stock exchange negotiations.
- **Data Import**: The system integrates with specialized services to import negotiation data automatically.
- **Template Rendering**: Dynamic user interfaces are rendered, responding to user interactions.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Promises are used for handling asynchronous operations, simplifying code complexity.

## Execution Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies with `npm install`.
3. To view the front-end, navigate to `client/index.html`.
4. Start the project with `npm start`. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Security and Design Patterns
Adhering to the MVC standard, the project also implements design patterns like Proxy and Factory to ensure code security and scalability.
